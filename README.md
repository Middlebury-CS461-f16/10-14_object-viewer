# 10-14_object-viewer
This is a simplistic .obj reader and viewer


This is very simple. The .obj files are loaded in directly in the code, and the view will need to be changed manually if it doesn't fit into the canonical cube.

Also note that because of the cross-origin problem, you can't open index.html directly in your web browser. I must be served through a web browser so that the obj files can be requested and loaded.
